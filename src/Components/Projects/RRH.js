                Hospitals are a stressful place and navigating the space can
                cause a lot of problems to the visitor, the patient and the
                hospital staff.

              <p>
                With this in mind we thought about our individual experiences at
                a hospital and thought of 4 major pain points as a visitor:

                  Hospital spaces are complex and vary in size. This makes
                  navigating a hospital extremely difficult even for a returning
                  visitor, as pertinent information such as patient location and
                  status are always updating.

                After putting together our research direction based on the four
                major pain points we identified, we decided to research the
                hospital setting as a whole. We interviewed hospital
                administration and their biggest issue they found was visitors
                asking this question:
              </p>
              <div className="coloredHeader" style={this.color()}>
                "Where do I go?"
              </div>
              <p>
                Based on that statement we decided to limit our scope to a
                visitor who is coming to see a patient, rather than an entire
                slew of user types.
              </p>
              {/*user flows/user types*/}
              <p>
                We also found that hospitals also run like a business as well.
                For starters, hospitals are required to keep certain information
                private about patients in order to abide to HIPAA laws. Using an
                AR in this kind of setting brings up an awkward conversation
                about privacy protection. Hospitals also need money and thus,
                desire benefits that come in through these kinds of
                applications.
